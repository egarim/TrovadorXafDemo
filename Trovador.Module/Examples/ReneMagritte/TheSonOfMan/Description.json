  "description": "The Son of Man is a surrealist self-portrait painted by Belgian artist René Magritte in 1964. It features a man in an overcoat and bowler hat standing before a sea and cloudy sky, with his face obscured by a hovering green apple—a motif Magritte often used. The painting explores themes of hidden identity and visual paradox.",
