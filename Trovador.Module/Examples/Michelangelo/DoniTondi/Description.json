  "description": "The Doni Tondo is the only finished panel painting by the mature Michelangelo to survive. Completed around 1507, this circular artwork portrays the Holy Family—Jesus, Mary, and Joseph—in the foreground, Saint John the Baptist in the middle-ground, and five nude male figures in the background. It is renowned for its complex symbolism, sculptural composition, and unique frame possibly designed by Michelangelo himself. The painting reflects domestic Renaissance ideals and may commemorate the marriage of Agnolo Doni and Maddalena Strozzi.",
